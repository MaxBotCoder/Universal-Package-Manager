This document will essentially be the bible for the project explaining what and how everything will be executed.
Hence develoupment for the Universal Package Manager aka U.P.M. will use this as referance material.

The goal is to provide a fast, efficent, secure and reliable way for develoupers to deploy apps on one sandboxed environment. 
Thus negating the need for developers to choose between supporting one OS very well or supporting many OSs poorly.
We aim to execute this by having the develoupers of this platform use an immutable blockchain based repo system to store their code and have it pulled down localy 
on to the user's computer which will then allow said to code to be compiled then then executed within a sandboxed environment.

Phase 1: Successfully create a blockchain based repo storing code on an Ethereum testnet (All NON-PROTOTYPE REPOS WILL BE ON THE MAINNET). 
Then proceed to Succesfully pull down the code to be ran locally on my computer (PRIOR TO SANDBOX)
Why?
- Ethereum has fairly high gas fees, this means that in order to write to the etherium network an induvidual must pay a fee. Thus encouraging develoupers to think prior to uploading their code
preasuring them to make/upload higher quality code aswell as discouraging malicious players from uploading malicous code to the repos. 

Phase 2: Creating a sandboxed environment to run said code from the repos, similar to flatpak applications in which the sandboxed environments will be self contained, wont mess around with root.
The sandbox will initaly support linux & windows then will later support mac, etc.. hopefully the opensource nature of this project will encourage ports of this package manager to various different platforms.

Phase 3: Create a package system which will allow code downloaded from Universal Package Manager repositories to always be executed within the sandboxed environment! 

Phase 4: Creating an easy to use GUI to work in unison with the pre-existing terminal interface which will be used. This interface will allow people to add/remove repos aswell as download apps, this
gui variant of U.P.M. will be dubbed the Universal App Store.
